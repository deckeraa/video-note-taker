## Development Mode

### cljs-devtools

To enable:

1. Open Chrome's DevTools,`Ctrl-Shift-i`
2. Open "Settings", `F1`
3. Check "Enable custom formatters" under the "Console" section
4. close and re-open DevTools

### Start Cider from Emacs:

Put this in your Emacs config file:

```
(setq cider-cljs-lein-repl "(do (use 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api) (start-figwheel!) (cljs-repl))")
```

Navigate to a clojurescript file and start a figwheel REPL with `cider-jack-in-clojurescript` or (`C-c M-J`)

### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein figwheel dev
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

### Run tests:

```
lein clean
lein doo phantom test once
```

The above command assumes that you have [phantomjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjs) installed. However, please note that [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo) can be configured to run cljs.test in many other JS environments (chrome, ie, safari, opera, slimer, node, rhino, or nashorn).

```
lein clean
lein figwheel devcards
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449/cards.html](http://localhost:3449/cards.html).
